# 💡 How the Game Works
The player starts at the beginning of the treasure island.

At each step, the player must make decisions to navigate the island.

The choices made (e.g., left or right paths, open or closed doors) will impact whether the player survives or finds the treasure.

The game ends when the player successfully finds the treasure or falls into danger.

Each decision is a unique experience, and no two games are exactly alike!
